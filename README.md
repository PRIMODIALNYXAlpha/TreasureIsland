# TreasureIsland
Treasure Island is an interactive text-based adventure game where players embark on a journey to find hidden treasure. The game requires players to make crucial decisions at each step, with each choice leading to a different outcome.

Gameplay
Start Your Adventure:
You begin at a crossroad and must choose whether to go "left" or "right."

Reach the Lake:
If you choose the correct path, you arrive at a lake. Decide whether to "wait" for a boat or "swim" across.

Face the Doors:
Successfully crossing the lake leads you to three colored doors: red, yellow, and blue. Your fate depends on your choice:

Red Door: Burned by fire – GAME OVER
Yellow Door: Congratulations, you found the treasure – YOU WIN!
Blue Door: Eaten by wild beasts – GAME OVER
Wrong Choices:
Along the way, wrong choices may result in falling into a hole, being attacked, or other unfortunate endings.
